ðŸ”¥ Key Insights from the Dashboard:
      Large pizzas drive the majority of revenue (almost 46%). Focusing marketing and upselling around large-sized pizzas could boost profits further.

Friday is the highest revenue-generating day.
      Special promotions on Fridays (e.g., "Friday Fiesta Deals") can capitalize on high customer activity.

Peak sales months are July and August.
      Likely driven by summer holidays â€” seasonal promotions should be planned accordingly.

September and October show the lowest order volumes.
      Possible reasons could be school starts, weather changes, or lack of campaigns. Introducing targeted discounts during these months can help lift sales.

Classic pizzas are the most popular category in terms of units sold (15K), but Supreme pizzas bring slightly more revenue.
    Insight: Supreme pizzas may have higher price points. You can focus on upselling Supreme pizzas to maximize revenue.

Customers buy about 2.32 pizzas per order on average.
    Promoting "combo offers" for 3 pizzas at a slight discount might help increase the average order size.

Revenue by Category is well-balanced, but Chicken pizzas are slightly behind others in sales volume.
    A Chicken-focused campaign could balance category sales further.
